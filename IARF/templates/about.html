            <h1>About the IARF</h1>
            <p>
                The Ishan is Always Right Foundation (or IARF for short) is a foundation created by the Ministry of Education of the People's Democratic Republic of Ishland for the purposes of
                making fun of people who say and do stupid stuff, and for correcting the stupid stuff they say and do.
                Over 99% of the world population is stupid<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/FkpqIp13HnA?t=40" target="0">[1]</a></sup>. That's quite unsettling, right?
                We here at the Ishlandian Ministry of Education are some of the few who are immune to ignorant bullshit. We have therefore taken on the task fo spreading the light of knowledge through a world filled with the darkness of idiocy.
