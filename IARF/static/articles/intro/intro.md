Hi everyone. Welcome to the IARF. This article will be focused more on explaining how the site works rather than its purpose (which you can read about on the "About" page). These articles will be based on stupid things I find on the internet (with your help, of course; use the submissions page to send me stupid things to put on this site). These stupid things can range from Lost Causers and Neo-Nazis being themselves on twitter to some idiot deciding to scream at people in public for no reason. 

This site is run off of donations and my income, so if you wouldn't mind, please consider donating to help keep this site up. As little as $1.00 can help significantly. 

I will try to the best of my capacity to use sources when correcting something stupid, but sometimes there just isn't a source (e.g. there's no source saying you shouldn't scream at people in public; it's just something you shouldn't do). So yeah, please feel free to recommend sources as well in your submissions, as it makes my job of finding sources sooooooooo much easier. Also feel free to utilize the sources I've listed for your own research, or even to fact-check me.

With that out of the way, let's begin. Cheers.
