<div style='margin: 50px; font-family: "Papyrus", "Copperplate", monospace;'>
Hi everyone. Welcome to the IARF (Ishan is Always Right Foundation). Here at the IARF, we work hard to be a bright light of knowledge to cut through the darkness of foolishness which fills this world. Our founders are some of the few who are totally immune to foolish yappery, and have taken on the fight against yappery as a full-time job. With your help and support, we at the IARF can expand our operations and tackle more yappery than anyone has ever tackled before.
